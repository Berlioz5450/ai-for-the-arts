This file is for reflecting on the use of copilot for learning python.
Copilot was useful in breaking down the coding process for each promt that I submitted. It provided explenations for each secction of the code.
For the promt involving classes, objects and metods, it broke it down into three sections explaining the purpose of each.
 *e.g 
 class Greeter: 
 *creates the bleuprint
 def_init_(self, name="world"): 
 * _init_ is the constructor which runs automatically when you create and OBJECT
 * name="world" gives a default value if you do not pass a name.
 * self.name = name stores data on the object
 def say_hello(self):
 * A method that uses self.name to print a personalised message.
 * self means "use my own data"
 def set_name(self, new_name):
 * A method to change tje object's data later.


 I had to edit some of the code that copilot gave in order for it to run but it was only a few words here and there that I have to correct. Overall the code that copilot provided was explained step by step and ran successfully. 

 When using copilot for the pseudocode exercise, it offereed a breakdown of the process and once again broke the code down to show the steps involved, before providing me with the full version. The code ran successfully on the first attempt.


 When experimenting with embedding the YouTube video, I found some initial issues with my code, the vidoe was displaying once I ran the code, however when I tried to play the video it came up with an error message and the video could not be played. I then asked copilot to help me with pasting the URL as I wondered if that was where I had gone wrong. After using copilot to help, I rewrote the URL and ran the code. The video then played properly. I then played about with the display size of the video until it fit nicely underneath the code. I found copilot useful here as it helped me fix my initial error and exxplained to me why my initial URL did not work.
