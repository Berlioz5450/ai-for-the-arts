This file is for reflecting on the use of copilot for learning python.
Copilot was useful in breaking down the coding process for each promt that I submitted. It provided explenations for each secction of the code.
For the promt involving classes, objects and metods, it broke it down into three sections explaining the purpose of each.
 e.g 
 class Greeter: 
 *creates the bleuprint
 def_init_(self, name="world"): 
 * _init_ is the constructor which runs automatically when you create and OBJECT
 * name="world" gives a default value if you do not pass a name.
 * self.name = name stores data on the object
 def say_hello(self):
 * A method that uses self.name to print a personalised message.
 * self means "use my own data"
 def set_name(self, new_name):
 * A method to change tje object's data later.
